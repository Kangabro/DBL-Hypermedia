\section*{What do we have to do}
In the project we will learn the skills to design and implement the Tu/e studeguide website.\\
Before we start we will discuss what skills we will bring to the group. Based on this we could make rough estimations on who will do what and share the workload.\\
AIn the first phase we are going to cooperate and create a clear and user-friendly design for the website.\\
Before we make a proof of concept, we will take a good look at the study guide and add upon the list of improvements already given to us. To add further improvements to this list we will look at our favourite sites and make note of what, we think, are the best features in the layout of these sites and what makes us like them.\\
To do this we plan to use a graph and layouts to visualize and make sure that the design we have is good. This will also give a clear goal for the team to work towards so we stay on the same line.\\
During the implementation phase our goals are learning and exercising the following skills:\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item GitHub, because improve efficiency for working together.
  \item HTML, CSS and JavaScript, for those not familiar yet.
  \item Optional design style, for example material design by Google.
  \item Optional Framework, for example Bootstrap.
\end{itemize}
In the end we expect to have a better site including the design materials and most importantly a improved skillset.\\
